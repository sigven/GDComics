  abstract    = "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a form of hypermutation
                 that occurs in some tumors due to defects in cellular DNA
                 mismatch repair. MSI is characterized by frequent somatic
                 mutations (i.e., cancer-specific mutations) that change the
                 length of simple repeats (e.g., AAAAA…., GATAGATAGATA...).
                 Clinical MSI tests evaluate the lengths of a handful of simple
                 repeat sites, while next-generation sequencing can assay many
                 more sites and offers a much more complete view of their
                 somatic mutation frequencies. Using somatic mutation data from
                 the exomes of a 361-tumor training set, we developed
                 classifiers to determine MSI status based on four
                 machine-learning frameworks. All frameworks had high accuracy,
                 and after choosing one we determined that it had >98\%
                 concordance with clinical tests in a separate 163-tumor test
                 set. Furthermore, this classifier retained high concordance
                 even when classifying tumors based on subsets of whole-exome
                 data. We have released a CRAN R package, MSIseq, based on this
                 classifier. MSIseq is faster and simpler to use than software
                 that requires large files of aligned sequenced reads. MSIseq
                 will be useful for genomic studies in which clinical MSI test
                 results are unavailable and for detecting possible
                 misclassifications by clinical tests.",

  abstract    = "Microsatellite instability (MSI) refers to the hypermutability
                 of short repetitive sequences in the genome caused by impaired
                 DNA mismatch repair. Although MSI has been studied for
                 decades, large amounts of sequencing data now available allows
                 us to examine the molecular fingerprints of MSI in greater
                 detail. Here, we analyse ∼8,000 exomes and ∼1,000 whole
                 genomes of cancer patients across 23 cancer types. Our
                 analysis reveals that the frequency of MSI events is highly
                 variable within and across tumour types. We also identify
                 genes in DNA repair and oncogenic pathways recurrently subject
                 to MSI and uncover non-coding loci that frequently display
                 MSI. Finally, we propose a highly accurate exome-based
                 predictive model for the MSI phenotype. These results advance
                 our understanding of the genomic drivers and consequences of
                 MSI, and our comprehensive catalogue of tumour-type-specific
                 MSI loci will enable panel-based MSI testing to identify
                 patients who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy.",
